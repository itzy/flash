How to use:
=====

First of all you need to implement CFlash in your own Anax-MVC version, simply place the class in your 'src'-folder.
At the top of your frontcontroller, add the following:

    // Get environment & autoloader and the $app-object.
    require __DIR__.'/config_with_app.php';

    // Get the class CFlash
    $di->setShared('flash', function() {
    $flash = new Anax\Flash\CFlash();
    return $flash;
    });

    // Starts the session, wich is required by Flash by itzy
    $app->session;

If you want to use the stylesheet that comes with the module, put flash.css in your css folder to make it work, then write the following code in your froncontroller (below the previous code):

    // Add stylesheet for flash by itzy
    $app->theme->addStylesheet('css/flash.css');
    
    
That's it!
Now you can get flash by itzy for your own website.


    // Put this in a route in your frontcontroller
    $app->flash->add('info', 'Better be on your toes, this needs your attention but is not urgent.');
    $app->flash->add('success', 'Yay! You are totally successful !');
    $app->flash->add('warning', 'Dude, I have to warn you, you do not look too good.');
    $app->flash->add('error', 'Oh snap, something went wrong!');
    
    //If you're in a controller
    $this->flash->add('info', 'Better be on your toes, this needs your attention but is not urgent.');
    $this->flash->add('success', 'Yay! You are totally successful !');
    $this->flash->add('warning', 'Dude, I have to warn you, you do not look too good.');
    $this->flash->add('error', 'Oh snap, something went wrong!');
